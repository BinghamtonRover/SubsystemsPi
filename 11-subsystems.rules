# UDev rules for the Subsystems Pi
# This file should be placed in /etc/udev/rules.d
# 
# This file allows our USB to be assigned a particular port each time, instead of the default random one. 
# Instead of /dev/ttyACM0 and /dev/ttyACM1, we can have /dev/imu and /dev/gps
# 
# The general gist of this file is that it reads data about the device (SUBSYSTEM and ATTRS), and, 
# based on the below rules, adds an alias for that device (SYMLINK). Each physical device may be 
# registered multiple times with the OS, so we use multiple checks (like USB port and video4linux).
# 
# Resources: 
# - To see info for a device, run `udevadm info -a -n /dev/deviceName`
# - For guidance on writing these kinds of files, see
